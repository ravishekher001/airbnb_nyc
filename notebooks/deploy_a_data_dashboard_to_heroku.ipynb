Dash is framework built on top of Plotly, which lets you create interactive dashboards such as the one shown below. If you are comfortable working with Pandas and heard of Flask before, then creating this application is relatively easy.\n",

One way to tackle that is to create an interactive dashboard, wherein, we can filter out the data based on categories and investigate the relationships between variables. In my case, visualizing hundreds of airbnb listings in a scatter plot was making the visual a little difficult to read, thus I created this interactive dashboard."
