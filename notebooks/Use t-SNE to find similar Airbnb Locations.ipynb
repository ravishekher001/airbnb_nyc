    "As of August 2019 there are about 48,864 airbnb listings in New York City. \n",

    "Can we use Machine Learning to find similar airbnb listings based on the features like: amenities offerred, description, price, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and numerous other features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity is based on 2200 features that have been constructed for each listing. \n",

    "I have used 2200 features to group Airbnb listings based on how similar they are. \n",

    "Using a dimensionality reduction technique called t-SNE, we can visualize each of the listings in a 3D space. The below plot shows an interactive dashboard that was built using `plotly and dash`.\n",

    "The raw `detailed listings` dataset was fairly clean, but it wasn't ready for use with Machine Learning models. Several columns had missing values which had to be dealt with and many others didn't have the correct data types. I have detailed all the steps that I took to clean this dataset in a blog post of its own: [New York City Airbnb Data Cleaning](https://shravan-kuchkula.github.io/nyc-airbnb-data-cleaning/). I have summarized the steps in the blog post here:\n",
    "* Drop columns that are not relevant to the problem. Example: URL, host picture etc.\n",
    "* Find missing values for each column.\n",
    "* Drop columns which have more than 20% missing data. Make a note of the columns.\n",
    "* Convert columns to their correct data type.\n",
